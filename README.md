# Inits
A collection of batch files that will help setup your project for anything! (Anything meaning only C++)

# Py? What?
Before I just had a batch file that will make all the files for you, however, that has changed for now.
The reason why this has changed is because one, my batch file was out of date, and two, I wanted to make a gui instead of a drag and drop then exectute method. The gui will allow you to customize your project a bit more and more features are later to come (such as templates that will install libraries for you)

# But I want my batch!
Batch is coming soon, don't worry.

# Why don't you just use the Visual Studio IDE you noob?
* I want to use my text editor because it runs lighting fast. (Sublime)

* I don't want to use a program that takes more than 10 seconds to launch.

* I get to customize my directory a bit more and make my build file simpler so that I don't have to get a degree just so that I am able to understand a build file.
